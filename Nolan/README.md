## Abstract

Spring 2018 is the target launch date for the new major in data science at the University of California, Berkeley. This major has been jointly developed by faculty from more than 20 departments, including statistics, electrical engineering and computer science, biology, physics, history, and political science. We describe some key components of the major and the involvement of faculty in statistics in creating several core courses. We also discuss the potential impact on the statistics major and the development of a less technical minor in data science. In fall 2017, 1027 students are enrolled in the freshman data science course and 264 are enrolled in the newly created upper division course in principles of data science. The demand for these courses continues to grow and offerings for both classes in spring 2018 were filled within 2 days of open registration.
