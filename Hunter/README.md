## Abstract

	
The experience of starting a data science program at a major research university is a good news/bad news story. On one hand, it has become clear in launching such a program that potential participants who are knowledgeable acknowledge and embrace the central role that statistics plays. On the other hand, not all potential participants are knowledgeable, which has led to some interesting and, hopefully, enlightening episodes. This presentation discusses some of the anecdotes and what we as a statistical community can learn from them.
