## Abstract

	
Statistical and Data Sciences (SDS) students at Smith College take courses across disciplines, including five core courses (Intro Stats, Regression, Intro Data Science, Intro Computer Science, and Linear Algebra), depth in statistics and computer science, a communication course, a domain application, and a capstone course. As designed, students may begin their major in SDS at many points, perhaps even after making progress in another major. For example, their first exposure to data analysis might be in a domain application course, then they further develop their skills by taking more SDS. Major courses can be completed in a variety of sequences. Although students take linear algebra before completing the major, with two version of Intro Stats, one requiring calculus and another with no pre-requisites, students less-prepared in math can continue through the major without facing immediate barriers. Students coming from technical backgrounds can also easily find their way to SDS. Computer science students might have their interest peaked after exposure to R in Intro Stats, while students less inclined to take a computer science might be eager to learn more after Intro to Data Science.
